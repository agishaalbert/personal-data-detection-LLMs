This dataset encapsulates essential customer information, providing a foundation for understanding consumer demographics, regional distribution, and identifying unique shoppers on the platform.\\n\\nAttribute Description:\\n- `customer_id` (String): A hexadecimal ID unique to each order placed on the Olist platform, serving as a primary key for order tracking. Examples: '827c1daa...', 'a3d6e70f...'.\\n- `customer_unique_id` (String): A distinct identifier for each customer, irrespective of the number of orders they place. This ID helps in distinguishing individual consumers and analyzing their purchasing patterns. Examples: 'c49f6a29...', 'ad7c7b01...'.\\n- `customer_zip_code_prefix` (Integer): The first five digits of the customer's postal code, indicating their geographical location and aiding in logistics and distribution analysis. Examples: 4363, 45436.\\n- `customer_city` (String): The name of the city where the customer resides, providing insights into the urban or rural distribution of the clientele. Examples: 'itupeva', 'sao paulo'.\\n- `customer_state` (String): The two-letter code representing the state within Brazil where the customer is located, essential for regional sales and marketing strategies. Examples: 'CE', 'SP', 'MG'.\\n\\nUse Case:\\nThis dataset is invaluable for stakeholders aiming to enhance customer relationship management (CRM) systems, improve targeted marketing strategies, and analyze regional sales trends.

ISSN: 0167-9236.\\n\\nIn the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.\\nThe inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T), etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure).\\n \\n4. Relevant Information:\\nThe two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables  are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\\nThese datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.\\nThe classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. \\n\\n5. Number of Instances: red wine - first 1599 instances; white wine - instances 1600 to 6497. \\n \\n6.
