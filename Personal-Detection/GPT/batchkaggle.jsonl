Relevant Information:\n\n   This dataset is based on \"Bank Marketing\" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).\n   The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.\n   This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns).\n   Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included.

Dataset: Title: Graduate Admission 2 \nDescription: ### Context\n\nThis dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. \nThe parameters included are : \n1. GRE Scores ( out of 340 )\n2. TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )\n3. University Rating ( out of 5 )\n4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )\n5. Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )\n6. Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )\n7. Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format.\nThe dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya. \n\n\n### Inspiration\nThis dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university. \n\n### Citation\nPlease cite the following if you are interested in using the dataset :\n**Mohan S Acharya, Asfia Armaan, Aneeta S Antony : A Comparison of Regression Models for Prediction of Graduate Admissions, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019**\n\nI would like to thank all of you for contributing to this dataset through discussions and questions.

Data spans from past transaction prices to present estimates for sale and rental values, making it ideal for real estate analysis, investment modeling, and trend forecasting.\n\n### Key Columns\n- **fullAddress**: Complete address of the property.\n- **postcode**: Postal code identifying specific areas in London.\n- **outcode**: First part of the postcode, grouping properties into broader geographic zones.\n- **latitude & longitude**: Geographic coordinates for mapping or location-based analysis.\n- **property details**: Includes `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `floorAreaSqM`, `livingRooms`, `tenure` (e.g., leasehold or freehold), and `propertyType` (e.g., flat, maisonette).\n- **energy rating**: Current energy rating, indicating the property\u2019s energy efficiency.\n  \n### Pricing Information\n- **Rental Estimates**: Ranges for estimated rental values (`rentEstimate_lowerPrice`, `rentEstimate_currentPrice`, `rentEstimate_upperPrice`).\n- **Sale Estimates**: Current sale price estimates with confidence levels and historical changes.\n    - `saleEstimate_currentPrice`: Current estimated sale price.\n    - `saleEstimate_confidenceLevel`: Confidence in the sale price estimate (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).\n    - `saleEstimate_valueChange`: Numeric and percentage change in sale value over time.\n- **Transaction History**: Date-stamped sale prices with historic price changes, providing insight into property appreciation or depreciation.\n\n### Potential Applications\nThis dataset enables a variety of analyses:\n- **Market Trend Analysis**: Track how property values and rents have evolved over time.\n- **Investment Insights**: Identify high-growth areas and property types based on historical and estimated price changes.\n- **Geospatial Analysis**: Use location data to visualize price distributions and trends across London.\n\n### Usage Recommendations\nThis dataset is well-suited for machine learning projects predicting property values, rent estimations, or analyzing urban property trends.

Data spans from past transaction prices to present estimates for sale and rental values, making it ideal for real estate analysis, investment modeling, and trend forecasting.\n\n### Key Columns\n- **fullAddress**: Complete address of the property.\n- **postcode**: Postal code identifying specific areas in London.\n- **outcode**: First part of the postcode, grouping properties into broader geographic zones.\n- **latitude & longitude**: Geographic coordinates for mapping or location-based analysis.\n- **property details**: Includes `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `floorAreaSqM`, `livingRooms`, `tenure` (e.g., leasehold or freehold), and `propertyType` (e.g., flat, maisonette).\n- **energy rating**: Current energy rating, indicating the property\u2019s energy efficiency.\n  \n### Pricing Information\n- **Rental Estimates**: Ranges for estimated rental values (`rentEstimate_lowerPrice`, `rentEstimate_currentPrice`, `rentEstimate_upperPrice`).\n- **Sale Estimates**: Current sale price estimates with confidence levels and historical changes.\n    - `saleEstimate_currentPrice`: Current estimated sale price.\n    - `saleEstimate_confidenceLevel`: Confidence in the sale price estimate (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).\n    - `saleEstimate_valueChange`: Numeric and percentage change in sale value over time.\n- **Transaction History**: Date-stamped sale prices with historic price changes, providing insight into property appreciation or depreciation.\n\n### Potential Applications\nThis dataset enables a variety of analyses:\n- **Market Trend Analysis**: Track how property values and rents have evolved over time.\n- **Investment Insights**: Identify high-growth areas and property types based on historical and estimated price changes.\n- **Geospatial Analysis**: Use location data to visualize price distributions and trends across London.\n\n### Usage Recommendations\nThis dataset is well-suited for machine learning projects predicting property values, rent estimations, or analyzing urban property trends. With rich details spanning multiple facets of the real estate market, it\u2019s an essential resource for data scientists, analysts, and investors exploring the London property market.\n\nFeatures: Index(['fullAddress', 'postcode', 'country', 'outcode', 'latitude',\n       'longitude', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms', 'floorAreaSqM', 'livingRooms',\n       'tenure', 'propertyType', 'currentEnergyRating',\n       'rentEstimate_lowerPrice', 'rentEstimate_currentPrice',\n       'rentEstimate_upperPrice', 'saleEstimate_lowerPrice',\n       'saleEstimate_currentPrice', 'saleEstimate_upperPrice',\n       'saleEstimate_confidenceLevel', 'saleEstimate_ingestedAt',\n       'saleEstimate_valueChange.numericChange',\n       'saleEstimate_valueChange.percentageChange',\n       'saleEstimate_valueChange.saleDate', 'history_date', 'history_price',\n       'history_percentageChange', 'history_numericChange'],\n      dtype='object')\n Column of the dataset to classify: 'saleEstimate_ingestedAt': ['2024-10-07T13:26:59.894Z']\nDoes this column, in the context of the dataset, contain information relating to a natural person?"}], "temperature": 0.3, "seed": 42}}
