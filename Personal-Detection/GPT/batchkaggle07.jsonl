Dataset: Title: UCI Heart Disease Data\nDescription: ### Context\n\nThis is a multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. It is composed of 14 attributes which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak \u2014 ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia.
