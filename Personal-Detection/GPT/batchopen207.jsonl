Elvin Kinney (in communication with Steven Salzberg) reported\\n          that a Cox regression application recorded a 60% accuracy\\n          in predicting that a patient will die.\\n \\n 4. Relevant Information:\\n   -- All the patients suffered heart attacks at some point in the past.\\n      Some are still alive and some are not.  The survival and still-alive\\n      variables, when taken together, indicate whether a patient survived\\n      for at least one year following the heart attack.  \\n \\n      The problem addressed by past researchers was to predict from the \\n      other variables whether or not the patient will survive at least\\n      one year.  The most difficult part of this problem is correctly\\n      predicting that the patient will NOT survive.  (Part of the difficulty\\n      seems to be the size of the data set.)\\n \\n 5. Number of Instances: 132\\n \\n 6. Number of Attributes: 13 (all numeric-valued)\\n \\n 7. Attribute Information:\\n    1. survival -- the number of months patient survived (has survived,\\n                   if patient is still alive).  Because all the patients\\n                   had their heart attacks at different times, it is \\n                   possible that some patients have survived less than\\n                   one year but they are still alive.  Check the second\\n                   variable to confirm this.  Such patients cannot be \\n                   used for the prediction task mentioned above.\\n    2. still-alive -- a binary variable.  0=dead at end of survival period,\\n                      1 means still alive \\n    3. age-at-heart-attack -- age in years when heart attack occurred\\n    4. pericardial-effusion -- binary. Pericardial effusion is fluid\\n                               around the heart.  0=no fluid, 1=fluid\\n    5. fractional-shortening -- a measure of contracility around the heart\\n                                lower numbers are increasingly abnormal\\n    6. epss -- E-point septal separation, another measure of contractility.  \\n               Larger numbers are increasingly abnormal.\\n    7. lvdd -- left ventricular end-diastolic dimension.  This is\\n               a measure of the size of the heart at end-diastole.\\n               Large hearts tend to be sick hearts.\\n    8. wall-motion-score -- a measure of how the segments of the left\\n                            ventricle are moving\\n    9. wall-motion-index -- equals wall-motion-score divided by number of\\n                            segments seen.  Usually 12-13 segments are seen\\n                            in an echocardiogram.  Use this variable INSTEAD\\n                            of the wall motion score.\\n    10. mult -- a derivate var which can be ignored\\n    11. name -- the name of the patient (I have replaced them with \"name\")\\n    12. group -- meaningless, ignore it\\n    13. alive-at-1 -- Boolean-valued. Derived from the first two attributes.\\n                      0 means patient was either dead after 1 year or had\\n                      been followed for less than 1 year.  1 means patient \\n                      was alive at 1 year.\\n \\n 8.
